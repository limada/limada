missing:
TextLayout.Height
two lines in 
CairoTextLayoutBackendHandler
to implement in cairo
wpf: not a problem
mac:
NSAttributedString.DrawString(Rectangle), same as Gdi
TextLayoutBackendHandler.LayoutInfo

changed temporary:
this is needed until Engines works in limaki
WPFEngine: RegisterBackends() 

strange:
Rectangle.Equals: uses size,location instead of x,y,w,l 
Rectangle.GetHashCode: maybe an error have a deeper look
